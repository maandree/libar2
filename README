NAME
	libar2 - Library for the Argon2-family of hashing functions

DESCRIPTION
	libar2 is a C library that implements the family of Argon2
	key derivation function, including Argon2d, Argon2i, and
	Argon2id, as well as Argon2ds which was not part of the
	submission to the Password Hashing Competition of 2013,
	which Argon2 won in 2015. As a key derivation function,
	Argon2 is well-suited for cryptographically hashing
	(one-way encrypting) passwords.
